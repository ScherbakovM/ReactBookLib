The Footwear Collection","authorCard":"Habermeier Christian, Jager Sebastian","descriptionCard":"100 years ago the brothers Adolf ('Adi') and Rudolf Dassler made their first pair of sports shoes. Hundreds of groundbreaking designs, epic moments, and star-studded collabs later, this book presents the first visual review of the adidas shoe through more than 350 models including never-before-seen prototypes and one-of-a-kind originals. To further develop and tailor his products to athletes' specific needs, Dassler asked them to return their worn footwear when no longer needed, with all the shoes eventually ending up in his attic (to this day, many athletes return their shoes to adidas, often as a thank you after winning a title or breaking a world record). This collection now makes up the 'adidas archive', one of the largest, if not the largest archive of any sports goods manufacturer in the world-which photographers Christian Habermeier and Sebastian Jager have been visually documenting in extreme detail for years. Shot using the highest reproduction techniques, these images reveal the fine details as much as the stains, the tears, the repair tape, the grass smudges, the faded autographs. It's all here, unmanipulated and captured in extremely high resolution-and with it comes to light the personal stories of each individual wearer. We encounter the shoes worn by West Germany's football team during its 'miraculous' 1954 World Cup win and those worn by Kathrine Switzer when she ran the Boston Marathon in 1967, before women were officially allowed to compete; custom models for stars from Madonna to Lionel Messi. Collabs with the likes of Pharrell Williams, Raf Simons, Stella McCartney, Parley for the Oceans or Yohji Yamamoto. As well as the brand's trailblazing techniques and materials, like its pioneering use of plastic waste that is intercepted from beaches and coastal communities. Accompanied by a foreword by designer Jacques Chassaing and expert texts, each picture tells us the why and the how, but also conveys the driving force behind adidas.."},{"id":7,"nameCard":"The Catcher in the Rye","authorCard":"J. D. Salinger","descriptionCard":"Holden Caulfield recalls the events of a weekend (Saturday afternoon to Monday afternoon) shortly before the previous year's Christmas, beginning at Pencey Preparatory Academy, a boarding school in Pennsylvania. Holden has just been expelled from Pencey because he had failed all of his classes except English. After causing the fencing team to forfeit a fencing match in New York because he accidentally lost the team’s equipment on the subway, he says goodbye to his history teacher, Mr. Spencer. "},{"id":8,"nameCard":"Demons ","authorCard":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","descriptionCard":"The first person narrator is a minor character, Anton Lavrentyevich G—v, who is a close friend and confidant of Stepan Verkhovensky. Young, educated, upright, and sensible, Anton Lavrentyevich is a local civil servant who has decided to write a chronicle of the strange events that have recently occurred in his town. Despite being a secondary character, he has a surprisingly intimate knowledge of all the characters and events, such that the narrative often seems to metamorphose into that of the omniscient third person. According to Joseph Frank, this unusual narrative point-of-view enables Dostoevsky \"to portray his main figures against a background of rumor, opinion and scandal-mongering that serves somewhat the function of a Greek chorus in relation to the central action.\"  The narrator's voice is intelligent, frequently ironic and psychologically perceptive, but it is only periodically the dominant voice, and often seems to disappear altogether. Much of the narrative unfolds dialogically, implied and explicated through the interactions of the characters, the internal dialogue of a single character, or through a combination of the two, rather than through the narrator's story-telling or description. In Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics the Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin describes Dostoevsky's literary style as polyphonic, with the cast of individual characters being a multiplicity of \"voice-ideas\", restlessly asserting and defining themselves in relation to each other. The narrator in this sense is present merely as an agent for recording the synchronisation of multiple autonomous narratives, with his own voice weaving in and out of the contrapuntal texture."},{"id":9,"nameCard":"The Kolobok","authorCard":"Chyukovskiy","descriptionCard":"book about delicios round"},{"id":10,"nameCard":"Миллионер из Вавилона","authorCard":"Адам Хилл","descriptionCard":"Успешный успех"}]
